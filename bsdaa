PRESIMLIFICATION USED MUCH BETTER.", "Since it&#39;s not important to update the terrain LOD in rel-time ( like 30 times in a second, even because it could not be on most PCs because it is a too much heavy procedure), so the first 2 examples propose a &#34;practical&#34; implementation, because the cumbersome procedure on a large 513x513 mesh, is done DIVIDIED into some 40 sub-stages: so to make the partial stages light to process, allowing to do terrain LOD update in &#34;background&#34;. In an adventure or flight game, this results in a never-interrupted real-time framerate even on older PCs or cheap PCs: so, the terrain&#39;s LOD in updated every 2 seconds but meanwhile there are no framerate discontinuities, and one can wals around the terrain smoothly. For a GIS software instead, it is useful because one can &#39;fly around&#39; with the camera smoothly. OpenGL usage is optimal, thanks using thoose &#34;vertex array&#34; function to send the triangles. wireframe is not omptimized, in fact it is slow, and only for tests or dydactical purposes.", "first varaiant only renders a single chunk based on an 513x513 mesh used as &#34;raw&#34; information to build a terrain with few triangles: you choose where it must be more detailed. example shows more detail closer to the camera", "there is also a multi-chunk example. an 4x4 lattice of 513x513 (that refers t the amount of &#34;raw&#34; height-data) alloes to visualize a large detailed terrain, and let implement dynamic loading with few or no glithes. USE MULTI-CHUNK TERRAIN ONLY IF YOU ARE QUITE SURE TO KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. &#34;Stiching&#34; of the chunks is not implemented, maybe in the future I will ad a function which allowes to do in easily..", "also an example will come which just does the procedure with a small 128x128 terrain and show the triangulation, doing all graphics with pure SDL library, with 3D graphics all software-rendered... or directly 2D graphics to draw the triangles, just to show the method in its simplest and most naive implementation", "there is a version (now only single-chunk) which does a pre-simplification of the heghtmap, so it keeps a set of fix points which preserve the shape of mountains and so... near the camera of course, points keep to be considered more densely depending on distance too.
